# Dice Roller App 🎲

A simple, interactive Android application built with **Jetpack Compose** that simulates rolling a six-sided dice. This project was developed to practice state management and modern UI development in Android.

## 🚀 Features
* **Interactive UI**: Click the "Roll" button to generate a random dice value.
* **Dynamic Content**: The dice image updates instantly based on the rolled result.
* **Modern Architecture**: Built entirely using Jetpack Compose and Material 3.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **State Management**: Used `remember` and `mutableStateOf` to handle UI updates during recomposition.
* **Conditional Logic**: Implemented `when` expressions to map numeric results to drawable resources.
* **Layouts**: Leveraged `Column`, `Row`, and `Spacer` for a clean, centered design.
